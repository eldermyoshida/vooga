This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.


<p>
This package contains all of the views for the arcade.  High-level design is explained here.


<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->

<p>
<b> public class MainView extends JFrame </b> <br>
This represents the main view of the arcade.  The functionality of this class is
 to switch between which mode is being displayed (Game Center, Social Center, 
 Game Store, etc.).  If we wished to add more modes to the arcade (such as an administration interface),
   then additional classes that extend JPanel can be added to this object using the
   changeViewPanel() method.
<ul>
<li> public void changeViewPanel(JPanel mode)
<ul><li> sets the current mode being displayed on the screen to the provided panel</ul>
</ul>

<br>

<b> public class ButtonPanel extends JPanel </b> <br>
Contains buttons for switching which mode is being shown in the main view.

<br><br>

<b> public class GameCenterPanel extends JPanel </b> <br>
Displays all the SnapShots on the screen for which games have been purchased by 
the user.

<br><br>

<b> public class AllSnapShots extends JPanel implements Scrollable </b> <br>
panel containing many individual SnapShots. AllSnapShots is Scrollable so when 
more SnapShots are available than fit on the screen, the rest can be viewed by 
scrolling down if this object is added to a JScrollPane

<br><br>

<b> public class SnapShot extends JPanel </b> <br>
Represents the name, rating, and thumbnail picture of a game. When a SnapShot is
 clicked, launches a DetailView of the game.

<br><br>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/MainView.png> <br>

This entire window is the MainView.  The left pane is the ButtonPanel, and the
center-right pane contains the current mode being displayed, which is the 
GameCenter in this picture.  This GameCenter is displaying SnapShots for each
game the user has bought.

<br> <br>

<b> public class DetailView extends JFrame </b> <br>
After clicking on a Snapshot, this DetailView is displayed.  The DetailView 
displays information about the game such as its name, author, a picture,
the average rating, a description for the game, and comments for the game.  
There is also the option for users to add ratings and comments here.  By clicking
on the Play button, the game represented by this DetailView will be launched.
However, if the game has not been bought yet, then a Buy button will be present
instead, which will launch the PaymentSelection window if clicked.<br><br>
If more game specific view stuff should be added (e.g. a network parlor, 
level editors), launching those capabilities should ideally happen from this View. 
Unfortunately, we did not include the extensibility of this view as a design goal,
so we leave it up to the game developers to allow access to these features once
the game is launched.

<br><br>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/DetailView.png> <br>
The DetailView for a game that has already been bought.

<br><br>

<b> public class SocialCenterPanel extends JPanel </b> <br>
This was not implemented.

<br><br>

<b> public class StorePanel extends JPanel </b> <br>
This view is very similar to that of the GameCenterPanel, except SnapShots for
all games available are visible here, instead of only those purchased.  Clicking
on these SnapShots will show a DetailView with an option to buy the game.  The
StorePanel also has a Publish button for adding new games.  Clicking this button
launches the PublishView.

<br><br>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/StoreView.png> <br>
The StorePanel allowing users to buy a game for their GameCenter library or
to publish a new game.


<br><br>

<b> public class RatingIcons </b> <br>
A helper class to create graphical representations of ratings from integer inputs.
This is used by both SnapShot and DetailView to display the rating of a game
as a picture of 0-5 stars.
<ul>
<li>
JLabel makeLabel(int rating)<br>
<ul><li> Makes a JLabel containing an icon for the provided rating. </ul>
<li>
String makeHTMLText(int rating) <br>
<ul><li> Makes HTML that can be used to create an image for the provided rating. 
Useful for displaying the icon within a JEditorPane.</ul>
</ul>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<b> Forms subpackage </b> <br>
It turns out there are a lot of forms to fill out in the Vooga arcade.  These are the login,
register new user, publish new game, select payment option for buying a game, filling in 
payment details for the selected payment option, and the displaying of high scores.

<br><br>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/FormHierarchy.png> <br>
The inheritance hierarchy for forms.

<br><br>

<b> public abstract class Form extends JFrame </b> <br>
This class represents a form that a user can fill out. Defines some useful 
utility methods that can be used by subclasses for creating common fields in forms.

<ul>
<li>
List &lt;JComponent&gt; makeComponents () <br>
<ul><li>Looks up the file src/arcade/resources/forms/ThisClassName and reads out 
which components are to be created in what order.  The form then adds those 
components onto the window.  If an additional subclass of Form is to be created, 
then an additional resource file needs to be added as well so Form can fill the 
correct components.
<li> an example resource file for LoginView: <br>
createLogo <br>
createUsernameField <br>
createPasswordField <br>
createMessageArea <br>
createButtons</ul>

<li>
JComponent createMessageArea()
<ul><li> Create a message area in the form where an error message can be 
displayed if the user puts in an invalid input.</ul>

<li>
void sendMessage(String message)
<ul><li>Display the provided message as an error to the user.</ul>


<li>
JComponent createInstruction(String instructionKeyword)
<ul><li>Creates an instruction message in the form.  The parameter is a keyword 
in the resource bundle corresponding to the message to be displayed. </ul>

<li>
JPanel createTextPanel(String descriptionKeyword, JTextField inputField)
<ul><li>Create a description defined by a descriptionKeyword in the resource
 bundle, and this description labels the provided input text field.</ul>


<li>
JComponent createFileSelector (String descriptionKeyword, String buttonKeyword, 
final FileChooserAction action, final FileFilter filter)
<ul><li>Create a description defined by a descriptionKeyword in the resource
 bundle, and a button with a label defined by the buttonKeyword in the resource 
 bundle.  Clicking this button pops up a FileChooser dialog box.  The FileChooser
 only shows files specified by the specified filter.
 The result of this dialog box is dealt with by the provided FileChooserAction. 
  A FileChooserAction is a single function interface that has a method for 
  approve(FileChooser chooser).</ul>

<li>
JComponent createImageSelector(String descriptionKeyword, String buttonKeyword, 
final FileChooserAction action)
<ul><li>creates a file selector with a default FileFilter allowing only image files
to be selected.</ul>

<li>
JComponent createButton(String buttonKeyword, ActionListener action)
<ul><li>Create a button with a label defined by a buttonKeyword in the resource 
bundle and an action to be performed if the button is clicked.</ul>

</ul>

<b> public abstract class Account extends Form </b> <br>
has creation of fields for username and password.  Any form that represents an 
account with a username and password should extend this class.

<br><br>

<b>public class LoginView extends Account </b> <br>
The initial view when the arcade is launched.  Gives the user the option to 
login or create a new account.  
<ul>
<li>void login()
<ul><li>sends username and password to be authenticated.  If a LoginErrorException 
is thrown, then displays an error message on the screen.  If successful,
then the MainView of the arcade is opened. </ul>
</ul>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/Login.png> <br>
Trying to login in

<br><br><br>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/LoginFailure.png> <br>
Was not a valid account, so got an error message

<br><br>

<b> public class RegisterView extends Account </b> <br>
This view is created when the register button is hit in the LoginView.  The 
RegisterView is a form allowing a new user to create an account.
<ul>
<li> void registerNewUser()
<ul><li> is called upon hitting register button.  Tries to register a new user.  
Some exception handling is dealt with: UsernameFormatException if username is not 
a valid format, DOBFormatException if date of birth formatted incorrectly, 
UsernameTakenException if the desired username has already been taken.  
If successful, then logs in and MainView is displayed. </ul> 
</ul>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/Register.png> <br>

If I try to register with an invalid username such as an empty string, the 
UsernameFormatException gets thrown, and I get this error message.

<br><br><br>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/RegisterFailureTaken.png> <br>
If I try to register with a username that's already taken, the UsernameTakenException
is thrown and I get this error message.

<br><br><br>

<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/RegisterFailureInvalidDOB.png> <br>
If I try to register with a improperly formatted date of birth, the DOBFormatException
is thrown and I get the error message and a reminder of how to format that field.

<br><br>
 
<b>public class PublishView extends Form </b><br>
This view is created by clicking the publish button in the game store. 
 Allows a game programmer to graphically enter all the required fields to 
 publish a game and display it in the arcade game store.
 
<ul>
<li>void publish
<ul><li>Try to publish a new game.  Invalid inputs are dealt with through
exception handling </ul>
</ul>

<b>public class ScoresView extends Form</b><br>
A view that is displayed upon ending a game.  This view shows the user's score,
a list of high scores, and the option to tweet the user's score.  These tweets
are done in the backend using the <a href Twitter4J library 
<a href = "http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html"> Twitter4J library </a>.  Many thanks
to them.

<br><br>
<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/ScoresView.png><br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br>

<b>public class PaymentSelection extends Form</b><br>
A view for choosing which payment method to use for buying a game. This view
is created upon clicking the buy button from the GameStore. Choosing an option 
will create the appropriate PaymentView to fill in the corresponding 
payment information. To add additional options, write the classpath of the 
PaymentView to create in the arcade/resources/PaymentOptions file, and in the 
ResourceBundle, enter a key as the PaymentView class name, and as the 
locale-specific translation for that payment option as its value.

<br><br>
<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/PaymentSelection.png><br>
Currently, only the Duke Card payment option has been added to the arcade.

<br><br>

<b> public abstract class PaymentView extends Form </b> <br>
This is where a user can enter his/her payment
 information to buy a game.  Different types of payment systems (e.g. 
 credit card, PayPal, Bitcoin) should 
 subclass this view to tailor which fields they need.  This view defines 
 only a Buy button which calls the abstract performTransaction() method

<ul>
<li>abstract void performTransaction()
<ul><li>gets all of the payment information entered by the user and submits it 
to be processed</ul>
</ul>

<b>public class DukePaymentView extends PaymentView</b><br>
The view where a user can enter his/her payment information to buy a game, 
tailored for the DukePaymentManager.  This does not actually do anything.

<br><br>
<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/DukePaymentView.png><br>
The view to enter the Duke FLEX payment information.


<br><br><br><br>

<b> Payment design </b> <br>
<img src = http://people.duke.edu/~ej48/files/Payment.png>
A PaymentView represents a form of payment information to be filled out.
The DukePaymentView is a specific implementation of PaymentView, requiring
payment information of name and Duke Card number.  After filling out the 
PaymentView, the Controller is given sufficient information to instantiate the appropriate
PaymentManager to deal with the request and hands the request off to its 
PaymentManager.  The PaymentManager then attempts to do the transaction.  If it
fails to go through, an InvalidPaymentException is thrown back to the PaymentView
so that it can inform the user. Otherwise, the game is successfully purchased
and added to the Game Center.
