/**
 * This class is dedicated to collision detection for 
 * shapes and provides useful methods to:
 * -confirm detections for shapes, either quickly or precisely
 * -check the side of a shape that another shape/point has with 
 *    (Treating all shapes as Rectangles in this case), choice 
 *    in parameters as velocity can be taken into account for 
 *    extra precision.
 *     
 * Please read through the methods, but this class can be both
 * extended to include specific functionality for specific shapes (i.e ellipses)
 * or one can simply use the precise methods and insert their specific shape
 * (note this will not work for checking the sides, as it will always treat the
 * shape as a rectangle!)
