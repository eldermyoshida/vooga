/**
 * The Player needs to do make the following decisions:
 * - does the command affect units or managers (eg. select units)?
 *      - if so, does it need to be sent to server/be bounced back. If it affects
 *      a manager, it can be executed immediately, but if it affects units, it
 *      needs to be sent to the server. 
 * - does the command affect the view or other non-gameplay related things?
 * 
 * This versin of Player will eventually be called HumanPlayer, and Player will
 * also be used with AI and the network to control other sets of managers.
