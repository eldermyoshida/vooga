/**
 * This class facilitates event logging to one unified log file.
 * The output of this logger does not have to be a file output, but in this
 * implementation it is.
 * 
 * A singleton pattern was chosen because it seemed to be the most closed form solution to the problem
 * without having to teach all team members the intricacies of file logging.
 * I plan on speaking with a TA or Professor Duvall before releasing this
 * as the final implementation (with the hope of finding a better solution),
 * but a working prototype was needed.
