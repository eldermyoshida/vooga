/**
 * This class is the tree of upgrades that any object that can be upgraded will
 * hold. For example, every unit will have an upgrade tree. Upgrades are being
 * stored in a tree like structure because in some cases upgrades are specified
 * in certain orders, so that buying a certain tier 1 upgrade does not 
 * necessarily mean that all tier 2 upgrades are now available. The root of the
 * tree is just a place holder. It would not contain an upgrade. The children
 * of the root represent the different "genres" of upgrades. The actually
 * upgrades start below the "genres".
