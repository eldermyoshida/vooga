 * This interface is implemented by the classes CanBeOccupied and
 * CannotBeOccupied that are then used as instance variables in the classes
 * that could possibly be occupied by Units. If the unit currently can be
 * occupied, it will have an instance of CanBeOccupied, otherwise it will have
 * an instance of CannotBeOccupied. In this way, occupying specific features
 * can be refactored out of the Sprite hierarchy.
