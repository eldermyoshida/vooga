This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the engine for real time strategy, RTS, style games.

<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->

<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->

<p>The general idea of creating a game with the RTS engine is that you specifiy the entire game definition in a game definition file. This file is in XML format and will be in the following format:
<p>&lt;too much xml&gt;<br>
  &lt;for mere mortals to write /&gt;
    <br>
&lt;/too much xml&gt;
<p>In addition to these default parameters, it is also possible to extend classes such as Building and Unit in order to create special types of these entities with custom functionality. For the most part, anything can be extended by providing a link to the java class that you want to use instead of the provided classes.
<p>As well as creating different entities, it is also possible to create different Upgrades which can change almost any thing about the users. For this purpose, the ReflectionHelper is provided in order for changes to be made to any property. @see vooga.rts.util.ReflectionHelper
