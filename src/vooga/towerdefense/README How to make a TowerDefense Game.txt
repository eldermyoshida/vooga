How to make a Tower Defense Game:

Designing a Game with the Game Editor:
When designing a game, a game developer can choose to write their own XML file manually, or use the game editor as a graphical interface to create the XML file. Each screen in the game editor helps the game developer create the specific type of element or section that they want in the game.
A Brief Walk Through of How to Use the Game Editor:
1) Name Your Game: the first screen asks the game developer to enter and confirm a name for their game. This will be used later in saving and naming the file.
2) Design Your View: the ViewEditorScreen allows the game developer to select the types, dimensions, and locations of all the screens they would like in their game’s view. They can create a MultipleScreenPanel by selecting that option in the drop down box, and then adding sub-screens to that panel in the menu that pops up when MultipleScreenPanel is selected. When the developer is satisfied with their view, they can selected “Add to game” and the view will be written to the XML file. Clicking the “next section” button bring the developer to the next design section.
3) Design Your Map: the MapEditorScreen allows the game developer to design a map with a background image, a tile size, certain tiles, and a path. A drag and drop mechanism allows the developer to drag tiles for background and pathing onto the map to easily create a custom map. The game developer can also specify spawn locations and the end destination by using the appropriate “s” & “d” files. The method for adding the map to the XML file and advancing to the next section is the same as for the view section.
4) Set starting values for the Player: the PlayerEditorScreen allows the game developer to set values that the Player starts with - for example a score of 0, the default money, etc. The method for adding the player to the XML file and advancing to the next section is the same as for the above sections.
5) Designing Game Elements: the GameElementEditorScreen helps the game developer add all the properties of the game elements to the XML file. They must specify the name (this will used as a reference for other game elements that contain this element, as in projectiles, or when actions take certain game elements, as in waves that contain units), type, image, dimension, and attributes and actions for this game element. Attributes can be added by selecting an attribute from the drop down box or selecting “New” and typing in a new attribute into the drop down box, then typing in a value if applicable to the text field, and then pressing “Add.” Actions can be added by selecting an action from the drop down box and pressing “Add.” Once add is clicked, a pop up box prompting the game developer for the appropriate parameters appears, and the game developer can enter the fields for this specific action. (note: these parameter descriptions are gotten using reflection and the ActionAnnotation as described later in this document). If the developer makes a mistake, they can clear attributes or actions from the text box by highlighting the error and clicking the appropriate clear button. The method for adding the game elements to the XML file and advancing to the next section is the same as for the above sections.
6) Design your rules: The RuleEditorScreen is used to designate the rules for the whole model. These can include rules such as losing at score zero, winning after all levels, etc. The method for adding the rules to the XML file and advancing to the next section is the same as for the above sections.
7) Design your levels: The LevelEditorScreen is used to design levels for the game. The levels can have specific rules that are only valid during that level and are added to the level graphically the same way that the model rules are added. WaveActions can be added to the level in a way that is analogous to the actions for the game elements. However, these options in the drop down box are populated only with actions that represent waves. The levels are made up of these collections of added waves. The method for adding the levels to the XML file and advancing to the next section is the same as for the above sections.
8) Finish and save: The final screen writes the full XML file with all the appropriate information that the game developer just selected. By selecting “save” the XML file is saved to the tower defense resource folder with the name specified on the first screen. It is ready to be loaded in and played!
